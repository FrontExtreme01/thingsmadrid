<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> After a bus ride of approximately one hour, we will arrive to Toledo, where we will first take a 
panoramic tour. You will be impressed from the very first moment, as we will go up to the Mirador del Valle, an elevated area from 
where we will have the best views of the city. At this point you will enjoy a short free time to take as many photos as you wish.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Then, we will go down to the old town of Toledo, where we will start a walking tour through the 
most important areas of the city, passing by places like the Cathedral, the Plaza de Zocodover or the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca,
where we will have the opportunity to access and visit it. Did you know that since 1986 Toledo is considered as World Heritage of Humanity? 
No doubt, this is synonymous that the city will surprise you.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> At the end of the guided tour of the city, we will have free time to rest and have lunch, as we 
will still have time to visit one of the most important wineries in Castilla La Mancha.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> After lunch, we will get back on the bus to head towards one of the most important wineries in the region. 
Here we will have the opportunity to enjoy a complete wine tourism experience, as well as delve into the art of winemaking in a unique setting, a 
prestigious winery that is surrounded by a carefully tended vineyard, where the most prestigious grape varieties in the country are found. Of course, 
we can't leave without tasting some of its best wines, accompanied by an aperitif.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Once we have finished our visit to the winery, we will return to Madrid, where we will finish the tour, very 
close to the Royal Palace.</p>
