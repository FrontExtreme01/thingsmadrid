<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> In the morning, we will depart from the Julià Travel office, direction to Segovia. We will park very 
close to the Aqueduct, which will be the first monument we will find in the city. Formed by 167 arches, it is considered one of the best 
preserved in the world. </p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> We will have the opportunity to take a walking tour of the city, which will take us first of all 
to the Plaza Mayor. There are several monuments in this place, such as the Town Hall of Segovia or the Juan Bravo Theatre, although the 
main protagonist is the Cathedral. We will enter inside the Cathedral, where we will have a complete guided tour.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> At the end of the visit inside the Cathedral, we will have a short free time. The next stop will 
be the Alcázar, one of the best preserved and most famous medieval castles in the world. It is even said to have inspired Walt Disney 
for some of his films, such as Cinderella's Castle or the Queen's Castle in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> After visiting the Alcázar, it will be time to return to Madrid, where we will have approximately 
one hour for lunch.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> In the afternoon, we will leave Madrid to go to the city of the three cultures, Toledo. We will walk 
through the streets of a city that has been declared a World Heritage Site since 1986. During our visit we will have the opportunity to walk 
through the cloisters of the courtyard and the royal coats of arms in the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes. We will discover the Synagogue 
of Santa María la Blanca which, although originally a synagogue, 211 years after its construction was expropriated and converted into a church.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> We can admire the world-famous painting by El Greco, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, which can be 
found in the Church of Santo Tomé. Did you know that El Greco himself lived in this wonderful city?</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> The walking tour will continue until we reach the Cathedral, considered of the most important Gothic 
Cathedrals in Spain. You will see it from the outside before the guided tour finishes. Then, you will have free time to explore Toledo on 
your own before returning to Madrid.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> After visiting these three monuments, we will have a short free time in the city, which you can use 
for shopping or having a coffee. After this time, it will be time to return to Madrid.</p>
