<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Check in at our office and board one of our air conditioned coaches for a panoramic tour. Leave Plaza de 
Oriente and head to the magnificent Puerta de Toledo. Did you know its construction dates back from the Napoleonic era?</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> See the oldest bridge in Madrid and drive next to the Manzanares River, from where you will have great views 
of the Royal Palace and the Almudena Cathedral. Pass by Plaza Mayor, once the center of Old Madrid and now the oldest square in the city. First build 
during the Habsburg period, it was the hearth of Madrid at the time. Spot significant sights such as the Puerta de Sol on our way to Paseo del Prado. 
Marvel at the most artistic street in the city and look at the Prado Museum.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Drive by Cibeles Fountain, where Real Madrid fans celebrate the team victories. Do not miss Puerta de Alcalá, 
the most famous of the five ancient gates into the city. You will make a stop for pictures at Las Ventas bullring and your guide will share some insights 
on the same. The last sights you will see on the tour are the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the important streets of Paseo de la Castellana and Gran Vía, 
well-known as the Broadway of Madrid.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Check in again at our office in central Madrid 15 minutes in advance of your tour. Leave the city in the early 
afternoon towards Toledo aboard one of our comfortable air-conditioned coaches.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Relax and enjoy the scenery on the way to the city. Follow your local guide on a walking tour of the Historic 
City of Toledo, World Heritage City since 1986. Once Spain’s capital, it is a perfect mix of Arab, Jewish and Christian cultures. Learn about its 
fantastic heritage and see how the coexistence of cultures through the centuries influenced its current architectural style.</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> Stroll amid the courtyard cloisters and royal coats of arms at the San Juan de los Reyes Monastery. Admire the 
building sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs to become a royal mausoleum. Right after the visit we will walk to the Synagogue of Sta. Maria la Blanca. 
Originally built as a synagogue, it was expropriated and became a Church only 211 years after it opened its doors. Today, it is a fantastic museum 
of Mudejar (Arabic) style that you will visit. Admire the world famous painting of by el Greco – The Burial of the Count of Orgaz – at the Church 
of St. Tomé. Did you know el Greco himself lived in this beautiful city?</p>

<p class="text-lg text-justify my-5"> The walking tour will continue until we reach the Cathedral, considered of the most important Gothic Cathedrals 
in Spain. You will see it from the outside before the guided tour finishes. Then, you will have free time to explore Toledo on your own before 
returning to Madrid.</p>
